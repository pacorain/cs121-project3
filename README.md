# cs121-project3
This is a project I did for a course.  It is a simple Caeser's Cypher program that takes a key and moves the alpha characters forward and backward using a file, based on the specifications given to me.

There probably is nothing that you can use in this repository, but feel free to with no restrictions; I hereby release all source code posted to this repository to the public domain.  I am simply uploading it to practice Git.
